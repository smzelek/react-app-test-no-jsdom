# React DOM Tests in a Real Browser

This repo uses Karma to launch **real instances of Chrome instead of using Jest+JSDOM**!

This setup allows you to run in Headful or Headless Chrome and visually debug your DOM tests, which is simply not possible in the default CRA+Jest+JSDOM setup.  

With this setup, you can still use React Testing Library as you may be used to - it just works! ðŸ’¥
